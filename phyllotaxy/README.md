## Experiment Details 

The *entire-2* accession used for this study (TGRC 3-705) was compared to the background genotype 3130.  Tomato resources were obtained from the U.C. Davis Tomato Genetics Resource Center (TGRC).  

We grew plants until they were 20 days old.  The plants were fixed fixed and prepared for histology using highthrough put stem staining protocol.  They were then photographed and the pictures were saved.  

The differnt photos refer to different seed packets.  At the time of the experiment, I was worried that there could be a seed mix-up or that the entire-2 phenotype was not as strong throughout generations. Although I ended up just pooling all the results once I verified that all the packets were the same as established in another study.  

Ciera Martinez fixed the tissue.
Sharon Zimmerman performed the histology and photographed the slides. 
Ciera performed the measurements in ImageJ.

## Measurement of angle divergence and meristem size

Measurement of angles were made on plant apices of both wild type (LA3130) and e-2 were harvested 20 days after germination. All measurements were made on leaves before sympodial growth.   The apices were then fixed in 3:1 acetic acid:ethanol and embedded in 100% paraffin.  The apices were sectioned onto slides and stained with toluidine blue. Sections were visualized and photographed using microscopy methods as described above.  In addition, older plants (50 days after germination) were also measured.  In the older plant population, the leaflets were removed, leaving only the petiole, these were labeled and aerial photographed above the plant were taken using Olympus SP-500 UZ camera.  ImageJ (version 1.46R) was then used to calculate angle divergence of the first five to eight leaves.  For quantifying meristem size, 12 day old plants were dissected to when meristem was visible and then photographed under a dissecting microscope at 100x magnification.  The meristems were measured in ImageJ (version 1.46R) using the straight line tool. Analysis and visualization was performed in using R (Team 2014) using R package ggplot2 (Wickham 2009).

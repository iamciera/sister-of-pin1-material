# Meristem Size Photographs

All plants were grown in phytotrays on (May 20, 2015) for 9 days before being transfered to soil. They then were allowed to grow in the growth chamber until June 4, 2015, when they were photographed.  They were 16 days old.

Unless noted, the plants were photographed at 100x on the dissecting microscope.

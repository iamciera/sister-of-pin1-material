# Quantifying Terminal Leaflet Shape

Plants were harvested 51 and 52 days after sowing, having six fully expanded leaves and were grown in a walk-in chamber (Conviron), temperature 22 C, 16:8 light-dark cycle. Leaflets were removed from the petiole of L1-L7 and placed under non reflective glass.  Cameras (Olympus SP-500 UZ) were mounted using a Adorma; 36' Deluxe Copy Stand, and remotely controlled with Cam2Com software (Sabsik).  Normalization was made from measurements from rulers present in each photograph.  Shape analysis was accomplished using ImageJ, by converting the photographs to binary images, with subsequent measurements of area, perimeter, circularity, aspect ratio, roundness, and solidity. The binary images were then processed using the Momocs package in R (Bonhomme, Picq, and Gaucherel 2014) to determine the elliptical fourier descriptors.

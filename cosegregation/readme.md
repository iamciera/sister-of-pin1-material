#Segregation Experiment

## Purpose

The overall purpose of the experiment is to further confirm that Solyc10g078370 SoPIN1a is responsible for the entire- 2 phenotype. We tested if the nucleotide change observed in e-2 plants segregated with a phenotypic deviation from a spiral phyllotactic pattern. We did this by genotyping and scoring a the progeny from a F1 individuals from an heterozygous individual (parentals = e2 homozygous and wildype)

We performed this experiment twice.  

n=112

**Genotype**

e2 = 42 (7/42 16.6% phenotyped as having a spiral)
wt = 22 (18/22 81.8% phenotyped as having a spiral)
het = 48 (45/48 93.7% phenotyped as having a spiral)

### Sequencing

Genotyping was performed using Sanger sequencing with primers which flank the nucleotide SNP present in e-2 individuals.
